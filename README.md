# Welcome to my jquery learning journey

First of all, I must say that this trip looks like it will be very enjoyable. Since I am also trying to improve my English, if you notice me in the explanations and the names I give to the variables, please warn me.


# Folders

I tried to give the names of the folders according to the example they contain. If there's a folder you don't understand the purpose of, warn me.

## Reminding

I have a blog site where I share what I have learned in Turkish. If you want to study in Turkish, you can visit this site. [ahmetcelik.web.tr](https://ahmetcelik.web.tr)
